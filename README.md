Portfolio is a project made in Gatsbyjs to present latest projects.

**Features.**
Projects from repositories presented with programaticaly made pages.

**Stack**
React, Gatsbyjs, GraphCms, Tailwind

This portfolio was made with use of Gatsbyjs and React.
Tailwind was used for practice reasons, although some custom css styles are also used. In gatsby-node.js file i used some custom schema injection for diffrent aproach to generating path to subsites made programaticaly. Today i would make it diffrent, but that was my way those days.
