In blog i try to show how to properly pick fruits, prepare them for process and making a batch.</p><p>Blog was also made as exercise to better understand mechanics of Gatsby.js and React.</p><p>In this exercise i learned how to: </p><p>- use GraphCms to edit content api and render it. Graphcms is not a cms rarely used in tutorials so figure out all the rules and how it works took me several more hours than i planed. One of examples is gatsby-source-graphcms which use not updated documentation and tutorial, so i needed to make workaround to render rich text as html without involving markdown editors.</p><p>- make pagination. I plan to use blog to post more content so sooner or later i would face problem with so big number of post of homepage. I personaly don&#39;t like lazy loading so i chosed instead. </p><p>- tags. This mechanics also simplify making specific categories for types of alcohols. Each category of alcohols has own tag and all i need to show them is make proper filter in graphql schema.</p><p>- passing styles with styled components. Styled components gives possibility to write styles and code in one file, but there is no point in cloning the same styles in similar pages so i used PageStyles.js for 4 pages with same styles. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"},"thumbnailAsset":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/RA5oq0fLSrOIggeaB6hc"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
