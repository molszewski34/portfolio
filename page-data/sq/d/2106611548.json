All pages are created by  \ngatsby-node with context passed with function CreatePages. Some nodes in  \ngraphql are created with “createTypes” and were made this way to pass  \nadditional data to query of pages. Normally this would be no case, but  \nin this build I tried to pass data in only one query and do not create  \nfew sets of data.\n\n## Features\n\n**Programaticaly made:**\n\n-   Blog Pages\n-   Tags\n-   Pagination\n-   Images rendering\n\n**Optimization**\n\n-   Gatsby images\n-   styled components\n\n**Desktop and mobile view**\n\n-   support for &lt; 640px and 1024px\n\n## Development\n\n**Stack**\n\n-   Gatsby.js\n-   React.js\n-   Node\n-   Graphql\n-   Headless Cms: GraphCms\n-   Gatsby starter: gatsby-starter-default npx gatsby new gatsby-starter-default [https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default \"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default\")\n-   npm packages:  \n    gatsby-plugin-image  \n    gatsby-plugin-react-helmet  \n    gatsby-omni-font-loader  \n    gatsby-plugin-styled-components  \n    gatsby-transformer-sharp  \n    gatsby-plugin-sharp  \n    gatsby-transformer-remark\n\n### Further Development\n\nDepending on popularity of blog i plan to add: Featured articles, comment section and authorization.\n\n## Installation\n\n-   Clone repository \\* Install dependencies\n-   Sing up on [https://hygraph.com/](https://hygraph.com/ \"https://hygraph.com/\")\n-   Create new schema and content [https://hygraph.com/docs](https://hygraph.com/docs \"https://hygraph.com/docs\")\n-   If you want to use current query, you must create project with name  \n    \"Polish Wines\" and schema with name \"Articles\". All schema fields must  \n    be named as in the current query, or you're going to get a GraphQL  \n    error.\n-   If you don't want to copy my schema, just follow Hygraph documentation linked above.\n-   Project use additional queries created by node with \"createTypes\".  \n    To make project work you need to name the fields in Hygraph the same,  \n    or change a whole function with different names for fields you created  \n    or you get graphql error and some fields in context fields in graphiql  \n    will be not visible and in result not passed to index.js\n-   Create file .env.development and copy your variables [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/ \"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/\"). In case of deployment to gh-pages name of file must be changed to .env.production.\n-   Run command npm start and check if you have any errors from graphql\n-   Project is by default hosted on localhost:8000\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis build uses Netlify and data from Hygraph. To run it  \nyou need to create Hygraph account and configure API on their service  \nwith endpoints of same name as designed in project. You also need to  \nchange name in GraphQL references.  \nGatsby-node.js use .env file to hide API config with environment name:  \nGRAPHCMS_ENDPOINT. For development use .env.development. Production use  \n.env.production.

All data is fetched from a test server maintained by plugin provider. If you want to test how it works, you must use local server created with some server emulator like WAMP or localy. Second, **not free** option is to rent a hosting server for your WordPress site, from which you're going to take data. It is only option for Editor to manage content and also only option if you want to host your project on Netlify. Both methods need plugins mentioned in [gatsby-source-wordpress](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wordpress \"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wordpress\") documentation\n\nI checked few free hosting options and all of them returned errors in fetching data from WordPress and some don't even have all options like featured image, excerpt, categories etc.  \n\n\n### Hosts checked:\n\n-   000Webhost\n-   InfinityFree\n-   AccuWeb Hosting\n-   x10hosting\n-   ByetHost\n\n### **Contact form and comments system**\n\nContact form and comments system are maintained by 3rd party providers and requires accounts in formspree and graphcomment. To make them work: create account and switch environments in places mentioned in their docs. Easy and clear.\n\n### **Online webpage with custom posts**\n\nAs mentioned above, you need some hosting server which keeps WordPress site online. It doesn't matter if it is free or not. If server pass all tests from gatsby-source-wordpress and creates graphql schema without errors, then you can host your \"dashboard\". WordPress site is only used to provide data (HTML) to Gatsby build and being transformed into static website. I know it is a bit nonsense to offer client resolution in which he needs to keep WordPress server online just to update content, but it is still less work and lower cost than writing a whole CMS and authentication. Netlify can host client static website for free, so the only real costs for client is keeping WordPress site alive.\n\n### Links:\n\n[Wordpress page](https://espossible-online.com/ \"https://espossible-online.com/\")\n\n[Es-possible-clone on Netlify](https://es-possible-gatsby-clone.netlify.app/ \"https://es-possible-gatsby-clone.netlify.app/\")\n\n[Link to Gatsby starter](https://github.com/wpgatsbymail/es-possible/blob/master/es-possible/Es-possible-clone-screenshot.png \"https://github.com/wpgatsbymail/es-possible/blob/master/es-possible/Es-possible-clone-screenshot.png\")\n\n\n"},"description":"Es-possible-clone is, as the title suggest, a clone of a website I made in WordPress for a client.
