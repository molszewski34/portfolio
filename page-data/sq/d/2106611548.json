In blog i try to show how to properly pick fruits, prepare them for process and making a batch.\n\nBlog was also made as exercise to better understand mechanics of Gatsby.js and React.\n\nIn this exercise i learned how to:\n\n\\- use GraphCms to edit content api and render it. Graphcms is not a cms rarely used in tutorials so figure out all the rules and how it works took me several more hours than i planed. One of examples is gatsby-source-graphcms which use not updated documentation and tutorial, so i needed to make workaround to render rich text as html without involving markdown editors.\n\n\\- make pagination. I plan to use blog to post more content so sooner or later i would face problem with so big number of post of homepage. I personaly don't like lazy loading so i chosed instead.\n\n\\- tags. This mechanics also simplify making specific categories for types of alcohols. Each category of alcohols has own tag and all i need to show them is make proper filter in graphql schema.\n\n\\- passing styles with styled components. Styled components gives possibility to write styles and code in one file, but there is no point in cloning the same styles in similar pages so i used PageStyles.js for 4 pages with same styles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"description":"Homemade Polish Wines is a blog made with use of Gatsby.js and HeadlessCMS.","slug":"homemade-polish-wines","link":"https://molszewski34.github.io/polish-homemade-alcohols/","features":"Programaticaly made: Blog Pages, tags, pagination, images rendering, Gatsby images, styled components, desktop and mobile view - support for < 640px and 1024px ","stack":"React, GatsbyJS, Bulma, NetlifyCMS","image":null,"thumbnailAsset":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/RA5oq0fLSrOIggeaB6hc"}},{"id":"cl78up9inpa6l0buuyalc572j","title":"Job listings with filtering solution","code":{"raw":{"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}]}},"text":{"markdown":"## **The challenge**\n\n#### Users should be able to:\n\n-   Filter over interactive elements: Role and position\n-   Remove filters\n-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page\n\n#### **Project elements:**\n\n-   dynamic filtering over list of jobs\n-   every job offer has: data about recruting company, position, role, level, contract, location, coding language, required tools and coresponding logo\n-   languages and tools acts as filters\n\n#### What i learned:\n\nHow to dynamicaly change background picture when switching from mobile to desktop view.\n\n    function App() {\n      const [windowWidth, setWindowWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);\n      const imageUrl = windowWidth <= 650 ? mobileImage : desktopImage;\n      \n    useEffect(() => {\n        const handleWindowResize = () => {\n            setWindowWidth(window.innerWidth);\n        };\n        \n        window.addEventListener('resize', handleWindowResize);\n\n        return () => {\n            window.removeEventListener('resize', handleWindowResize);\n        }\n    }, []);\n    }\n        <div className=\"App \">\n          <header className=\"bg-teal-600 w-screen \">\n            <img className=\"w-screen h-52 sm:w-screen\" \n            src={imageUrl} alt=\"header img\" />\n          </header>\n    <div>\n\n\n"},"description":"I made this page using design from Fontend mentor.
